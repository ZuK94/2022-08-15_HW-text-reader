        arts of man and nature mingled together, for once harmonizing, for
        Torquay has not been spoilt by builders, at least as seen from the bay.
        Behind, Brixham way, the red sails of the fishing boats flapped lazily
        in an idle breeze. Four men-of-war lay still in the bay, guardians of
        the peace, comforting, reassuring, a hint of what lay behind. How
        peaceful these monsters of the deep looked. Slumbering surely were they.
        What was that? A puff of white smoke, then a solemn sound, which sped
        across the bay, and echoed over the hills. One of the monsters had
        spoken, just to show it was wide awake. It had a curious effect on the
        man leaning over the side of the Sea-mew, the yacht that had just come
        to anchor. It startled him from his reverie, from his contemplation of
        all that was so beautiful around him. For a moment he looked across at
        the warships, and saw the smoke drifting away, then he turned and looked

        muttered. "Would to God it were, and that he were safe on board my
        yacht. All for a woman, and such a woman!" He clenched his fist and
        struck the rail. Picton Woodridge, owner of the Sea-mew, was a man of
        about thirty, tall, good looking, genial, popular, but lonely, if a
        popular man can be described as lonely, and there are such men. He was
        rich, a sportsman. His stable at Haverton contained good horses: a Derby
        winner in prospect, one of the best stayers in England, and above all
        Tearaway, a black filly, three years old, described by her trainer,
        Brant Blackett, as "a beauty, a real gem, and fast as the wind." He
        ought to have been a happy man. To all outward appearances he was, but
